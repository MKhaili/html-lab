  <h1>Elden Ring</h1>

  <h2>Classes</h2>

  <p><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Classes</a> for Elden Ring are the starting archetypes available
    to the player. All Elden Ring Classes follow similar
    concept to that of the Dark Souls series, choosing a class determines the player's starting Stats and Equipment
    which can then be improved and upgraded later on as you progress throughout the game. This page contains a full list
    of all the classes in the game.

    Players can select a Keepsake (like Gifts of Dark Souls) during Character Creation, which provide more customization
    options during early game.</p>
